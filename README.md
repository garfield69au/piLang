# pyduq

This project is a generic, meta-driven data quality validation suite. This project
was developed by Shane J. Downey as parr of his M.Phil research study. 

The purpose of pyduq is to provide a detailed analysis of the quality of data by
comparing actual data against a set of generic data quality rules. The data quality 
rules are an implementation of LANG. LANG is a prior research study that provided
a set of data quality pseudo-SQL statements that implement the 8 dimensions of 
data quality.
